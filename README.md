#Practicing with Underscore.js


###Assignment
* Create 20 examples (at least) of using various Underscore.js functions
* Include comments explaining what how you think the function will do
* Include questions or concerns in the notes
* Learn it

###Overview
For this project we were asked to come up with 20 examples of using Underscore.js in various ways. The goal of the project was to learn and demonstrate our level of understanding. The bulk of the project can be viewed in the 'main.js' file. **I also took this as an opportunity to practice jQuery (push the green button to see)**. 

###My Thoughts
My initial take on Underscore.js is positive. Many of the functions seem like big time savers compared to vanilla JavaScript and much simpler to write. I'm stumbling with syntax a bit, but practice makes perfect (well, maybe just *better*).
